DEV/PROD System:
- develop branch
  -> deploy to digitalocean/dev/
  -> db = words_dev
  -> port = 3000

- master branch
  -> deploy to digitalocean/prod/
  -> db = words_prod
  -> port = 3001



App will be something like:

> Word pops up
> User has to enter as many rhyming words as possible
> Time limit runs out
> App shows how many u got right

So API should be like:
> getRhymesForWord(word)
> /word-challenges-api/rhymes/{word}

Future features:
Want to be able to track how many times users have got each rhyme for each word
e.g. BaseWord List, Rhyme Fist, Count 17
Then give them a score based on how many people got each word compared to others



How would this work in mongodb?




DB:

Base Word, Word it rhymes with, score, syllables


-> API call -> rhymes/list

list, fist, 40, 1
list, kissed, 49, 1
list, missed, 60, 1


MongoDB:

Words: {
  List: {
    rhymes: [
      { rhyme: "fist", score: 3, syllables: 1, successCount: 17 },
      { rhyme: "missed", score: 5, syllables: 1, successCount: 13 },
    ],
    difficulty: 3
  }
  Face: {
    ...
  }
}

-> [{ word: "fist", score: 2, syllables: 1 }, { word: "missed", score: 2, syllables: 1 }]




SQL:

Table base-words: (to make API call to)
word, difficulty, 

Table rhyming-words:
base word, rhyming word, score, syllables

SELECT * FROM rhyming-words WHERE base-word equals {word}
