DEV/PROD System:
- develop branch
  -> deploy to digitalocean/dev/
  -> db = words_dev
  -> port = 3000

- master branch
  -> deploy to digitalocean/prod/
  -> db = words_prod
  -> port = 3001

Server setup:
http requests are proxied to the node apps running at ports 3000 and 3001
requests to /dev go to 3000
requests to /prod go to 3001
this is configured in /etc/nginx/sites-available/word-monkey-api.xyz

node processes are managed by pm2, set to auto run on server startup
can be stopped/restarted via pm2 (e.g. pm2 list, pm2 stop develop, pm2 restart production)


Deploy Process:
git push to develop/master
ssh into server
cd into ~/dev/word-challenges-api or ~/prod/word-challenges-api
git pull
pm2 restart develop or pm2 restart production
