Security:
- add api key to app
- send api key on requests (on custom header?)
- decrypt key on server, on receiving requests
- if key is incorrect then reject

- add easy definitions
- tweak/check definitions

- make prod environment, setup on app different env variables for prod/dev
  - when adding prod, will need to add thing for react native config to android (see github page)
- look into AWS - https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/deploy-nodejs-web-app/

- load test api

- look into ddos protection/general api security methods
